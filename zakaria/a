first setup the server;
select
    if the sock of the server
        accept
        if new add it to a vector of clients and 
        add the fdsock to readset
        how can i know if he is new ? store the fd in a map;
    if the sock of reading
        read and parse the request;
        //how can i know the reading is done?
            i think is done when recv returns !!
       // move the sock to writingset
    if the sock for writing
        then send the response
        //how can i know the writing is done?
            i think is done when send returns !!
        //move the sock to readingset


i should put the client in a vector in server class
            in who ever running the server;




the request:
    i read the header in not more than 9000bytes  ---> length exceeded
    i read the body
